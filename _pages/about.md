## Community
Since almost all of the skills I possess were self-taught, I also have to actively participate in internet forums to continue to grow. Currently, I am active in the [Meta4sec](https://discord.gg/meta4sec) and [Stress Capitals](https://discord.gg/stresscapitals) communities.

## Cybersecurity Playground
For brainstorming, amidst my busy schedule of performing application pentest for clients, I work on some machines on HackTheBox and also on TryHackMe.
